<h2>Development Status</h2>

<p>RWE is currently incomplete, read the blog posts to find out about the latest progress.</p>

<p>
With TA data files, the Skirmish menu path works and you can load into the game,
walk your commander around and fire your laser at other commanders until you both explode.
You can also do this to other players on the internet,
using the included launcher application to host or join a multiplayer game room.
Work is currently focused on implementing the in-game UI.
