  Total Annihilation is a real-time strategy game that was released in 1997.
  For over twenty years fans have been playing the game,
  making new maps, units, and mods that expand and enhance the gameplay.
  However Total Annihilation is an old, proprietary game.
  It contains bugs, limitations and incompatibilities
  that make it difficult for players to enjoy on modern PCs
  and for modders to bring their latest ideas to life.
</p>
<p>
  Robot War Engine is an original open-source game engine
  built using modern tools that aims to provide an experience
  very similar to Total Annihilation,
  but without the limitations of the original game engine.
  As a player you will be able to enjoy the game without worrying
  about compatibility or technical tweaks to make it run on a newer version of Windows
  or to play with other people online.
  As a modder you will enjoy freedom from old limitations,
  allowing you to put more content in your mods,
  and you can take advantage of new enhancements to better express your ideas.

  RWE is incomplete and cannot be used to play real games yet.
  Check out the latest blog posts to keep up-to-date on development progress.
  If you are an experienced software developer and would like to help out,
  please get in touch.
  There is much work to be done both on the core C++/OpenGL game engine
  and on the Electron-based launcher application.
