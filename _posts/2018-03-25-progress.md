This week, RWE learnt about how projectiles collide with units and about unit health and damage. Lasers now collide with units, and units have the concept of damage, but lasers still don't actually apply damage yet. Since units have health now, they also have health bars, toggled by pressing the key to the left of "1" on your keyboard (on English layouts this is normally "`").

Next I will work on allowing the lasers to do damage and on what happens when a unit's health reaches 0. I would normally say "next week", but with the Easter holidays coming up I am planning to take a much needed break, so I might skip updates over the next couple of weeks. Regular progress should resume some time mid-April.

Here you see the two commanders locked in an eternal struggle, lasers pinging harmlessly off the other commander's indestructible hull.
