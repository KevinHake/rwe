This week, RWE learned to make space for the gui and how to render the minimap. RWE now displays the minimap, shows dots for the units and shows where the camera is. When you hover over a unit in the main view, it is highlighted on the minimap. You can also drag your mouse on the minimap to move the camera around.

You can't select units or issue orders using the minimap yet, but hopefully that will happen soon.

Next week I will continue working on the minimap and on the in-game UI in general.

Today's gif shows off the new minimap.
