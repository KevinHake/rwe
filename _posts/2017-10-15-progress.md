This week, RWE learnt to load and display textured 3do models. This means that we can now display the commander's model on the map. The flare on the commander's d-gun is visible because these are hidden by the commander's script, and we don't yet have a scripting engine to run it.

The next goal is to start on the script engine to the point that we can run the commander's Create function and hide these flares. Before that though, I'm going to consider moving the graphics system to use shaders rather than the fixed function pipeline. This should make it more flexible to work with.
