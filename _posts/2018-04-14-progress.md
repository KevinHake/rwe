Update time, here are the things that have happened in RWE since I last posted:

* RWE learnt to shade pieces on buildings, so they look more similar to their shaded TA counterparts. Some work still to be done here but it's good enough for now.
* RWE learnt about cob "spin" commands, so units like radar towers now spin as expected.
* The installer received some minor improvements, the main thing is that the installer uses the full name, "Robot War Engine" instead of "RWE".
* Weapons now deal damage to units within the area of effect when they hit.
* Weapons can now emit smoke at the expected times.
* Units can die, and explode when they die, dealing damage.

Next I will look at making the game end when a commander dies, either back to the main menu or exiting entirely.

Here are a couple of gifs, originally posted on Discord, illustrating bits of progress.
