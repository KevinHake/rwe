This week, RWE learnt to know when a unit is currently under the mouse cursor and will allow you to select that unit, if it's yours. When a unit is selected we also play the appropriate selection sound.

I also did some work on team colour, so units are now displayed with the team colour selected when you set up the game. You'll notice that this week's commander is yellow.

Keen observers may notice that the selection cursor isn't animating yet. That will probably come later when I have a more interesting cursor to work with (e.g. the attack cursor).

The next goal is to introduce the concept of orders and allow a unit to be ordered to move.
