I know I said there wouldn't be an update but I found some time anyway.

This week, RWE learnt to display static (non-animating) sprite-based features and their shadows. RWE will also now put the camera over the first start position when loading in.

The next goal is to make a start on loading units so we can load the commander onto the map.
