This week, RWE learnt to spawn in the correct commander for the player's side (previously it was hard-coded to "armcom"). To make this work we now read unit FBI files and sidedata.tdf. This means we can successfully start as Core now!

You might also notice that the flares are not visible on the Core commander's model. This is because RWE also learnt to read and interpret cob scripts; it now runs the "Create" function when a unit is spawned, which hides these flares. Only a few game-affecting operations are implemented at the moment (e.g. "hide") but this will expand as the engine gains support for these concepts.

The next goal will be to allow selection and, hopefully, movement of the commander around the map.
