This week RWE learnt more about attack orders and weapon aiming logic. This has largely been internal restructuring to allow multiple weapons to operate independently and to allow unit to be smarter about carrying out attack orders. Weapons still can't fire yet, but the logic surrounding firing is gradually coming together.

One visible improvement is that the commander can now walk into range of a target when he receives an attack-ground order that is out of range.

Next week I'll continue to refine the details and extend this logic to attack orders that target a unit. This is more complicated because the target can potentially change location.
