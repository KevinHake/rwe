Hi all. For this update I've been working on the map selection dialog in the launcher. It now shows the minimap and the map info for the selected map.

Next I will look at tidying up some of the roughest edges of the launcher and start looking back into engine work. The next interesting feature for the engine is to start showing the in-game UI.

Today's gif demonstrates the improvements to the map selection dialog.
