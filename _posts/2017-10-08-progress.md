Not much to report this week, I've been taking a bit of a break.

This week RWE learned about the concept of units and how to display them. At the start of the game it now spawns in an Arm commander, which is represented by this magenta square.

The next goal is to write the 3do and texture loader so we can display the commander's real model.
