This week, RWE learnt about giving orders using the minimap. Units can now be told to move or attack using the minimap instead of the main world. RWE also understands that units could also be selected using the minimap, but RWE currently only supports the right-click interface for TA, which doesn't let you select units using the minimap. However this will work when the left-click interface is also supported.

The next goal is to teach RWE about the orders menu that appears on the side of the screen, below the minimap. The first step here involves refactoring some of the existing code to allow me to reuse the existing UI components that were implemented for the main menu.

Today's gif shows how you can now use the minimap to issue an attack order.
