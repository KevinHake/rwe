This week RWE learnt about the end of the game. RWE now detects when a commander dies, marks the owning player as defeated and destroys their remaining units. Once only one player remains in the game (or 0 if commanders destroy each other), the game is considered finished and RWE exits after a brief delay. For now, there's no victory/defeat banner, hopefully this should be straightforward to add in.

RWE also received a couple of fixes for Linux, and appears to now work on Ubuntu 16.04 without any issues.

Next week I will look at polishing up this behaviour a bit more (the victory/defeat text would be nice) and then consider starting on network multiplayer.
