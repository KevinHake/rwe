title: "Progress Update 2017-09-24"

This week, RWE learnt to launch into a "game" that displays the map terrain. You can pan around this terrain with the arrow keys.

This means that RWE has progressed from "Menu Simulator" to "Map Viewer". Woop!

The next goal is to load and display map features (metal patches, trees etc.)

No gif this time, but here's a picture of RWE displaying part of my favourite map.

Edit: By the way, I forgot to mention, I'm away next week so there probably won't be an update. I'll resume the week after.
