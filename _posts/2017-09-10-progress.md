This week, RWE learnt to display the map selection dialog properly. It now knows how to display listboxes, scrollbars and how to read map TNT files to display the minimap preview. It also learnt some things about gui element focus and how buttons should respond to keyboard input.

You can see these improvements in the latest build, which is available via the link in the original post.

The next goal is to implement the player slots on the Skirmish menu. Once this is done, we'll have all the information necessary to set up a skirmish game.

Here's a little showcase of the work so far.
