This week I rewrote the pathfinder to use jump point search. This means that the pathfinder is fast again! I should also mention that RWE no longer crashes if you try to tell a unit to go to a place it can't reach.

Next I will teach RWE about movement classes and how they restrict where units can go. I will also make some further improvements to the pathfinder to prevent lag in pathological cases (e.g. when the destination is unreachable) and to prevent units from getting stuck.
