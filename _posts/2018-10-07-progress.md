title: "Progress Update 2018-10-07"

Hi all. This week I've been working on the game room in the launcher. Players can now choose their side, colour and team. Today's gif shows this off.

The launcher also gained the concept of player slots, which you can see a hint of in the gif. In the future you'll be able to move between slots, add AI players or open/close slots.

You still can't pick the map, so next I will aim to work on that next, plus other game settings.

Sadly I'm not in a position to return to doing regular updates as I'm going through some life stuff that I didn't anticipate, so I'll just be doing what I can here and there. I'm keen to return once things are better but I don't know when that will be yet.
