This week, I originally promised to do pathfinding, but since a few of you have tried the program out and encountered some problems, I've been working on other improvements instead that should help with this.

RWE now writes log output to %AppData%/RWE/rwe.log. It doesn't log much at the moment but having it available will make it easier for me to start logging relevant information when I add new features.

I've also been working to replace the rest of the fixed-function rendering logic. This is mostly done (just one call left!) but this has led to noticeable performance regression, as the code I've written for using shaders is currently very naive.

Next I'll finish off the changes to the rendering pipeline and bring performance back up to an acceptable level. After that, I'll get back on track with more gameplay features.
