This week, RWE learnt about laser projectiles. When a unit fires its weapon, RWE now creates a projectile at the firing point. Projectiles travel across the map and are destroyed when they collide with terrain.

Right now there is only one kind of projectile implemented and it looks coincidentally very similar to the ARM commander's laser; perfect for this week's gif.

As you can see there still some important things to do, most obviously the impact effect when the laser hits the ground.

Next week I will continue work on projectiles to add impact effects and to allow them to collide with units.

Heralding the arrival of this critical laser technology, I now officially upgrade the working title of RWE from Commander Walker Pro to Commander Laser Battle Arena. Sounds cool, huh?
