This week, RWE learnt to display the player setup part of the Skirmish menu. You can now configure players, their side, colour, team, metal and energy. You can also press the Start button, which sends you to the loading screen. The loading screen just shows the loading bars at various stages as a demo/debugging aid.

You can see these improvements in the latest build, which is available via the link in the original post.

The next goal is to implement the loading logic. A lot happens during loading so this will probably take some time, but once this is finished we'll be able to launch into the actual game environment.

Here's a demo of the improvements this week.
