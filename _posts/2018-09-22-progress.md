Here's the update, as promised.

Since last time I've been working on the launcher a lot on and off. The launcher is now capable of setting up and launching a public online game of RWE via a master game server, which I am hosting. There's still a lot of work to be done -- for example, right now you can't even change any game settings -- but the basic foundation appears to be working, so things can only improve from here.

For next time I'll focus on improving the launcher so that you can choose game settings and pick the map.

If you hang out in the RWE discord channel I will occasionally be looking for volunteers to help me test some of the network-related features.

For today's gif, here's the launcher in action hosting and starting a game.
